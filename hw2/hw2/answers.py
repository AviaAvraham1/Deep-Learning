**Your answer:**

1. A. the shape of this tensor is (64,512,64,1024) - we derive every entrance in the matrix according to every entrance in the other matrix.
   B. yes, the Jacobian matrix is sparse since each y_i,j is a function of only one x_i,j 
   (the ith sample in the batch), so we get a diagonal matrix: diag(J_i), where J_i is the
    Jacobian matrix of y_i with respect to x_i.
   C. There is no need to materialize the whole Jacobian matrix, instead of calculating by the 
   chain-rule: dL/dx = dL/dy * dy/dx, we can use the fact that the Jacobian matrix is diagonal matrix where
   each element is the Jacobian matrix of y_i with respect to x_i, i.e W^T (the derivative of x*W^T+b w.r.t x)
   and compute dL/dx = dL/dy * W^T (since dL/dx_i = dL/dy_i * W^T for each i, this is equvilent to multiplying
   directly by W^T).


2. A. (64,512,512,1024).
   B. yes, similarly to the previous question, the Jacobian matrix is sparse since each y_i,j depends on only
   the j-th row of W. so the Jacobian matrix is a block-diagonal matrix where each block is a matrix of size 512x1024.
   C. we can use the same trick as before, instead of calculating the whole Jacobian matrix, we can calculate
   dL/dW = dL/dy * X (since X is the derivative of X*W^T+b w.r.t W).

**Your answer:**

No, it is not required to use back-propagation in order to train neural networks with descent-based optimization.
The back-propagation algorithm is a method to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights
of the network, but actually there are other methods to compute gardients to use in gradient descent optimization.

For example, we learned in the Automatic Differentiation tutorial, that we can use numerical diffrentiation
(the explicit method to compute gradients, as we learned in Calculus) but as we said, it is inexact and very expensive.
There is also another option of using automatic differentiation in forward mode, which is different from backpropagation which is done in
reverse mode. However also this option is also not as efficient as backpropagation.
